 I am an undergraduate student at UC Irvine pursuing Software Engineering. I consistently go above and beyond for myself and others, bringing success wherever I go.
 My early experiences with coding have given me the ability to quickly understand programming languages and their complexities, enabling me to tackle challenges with creativity and effectiveness.
