 Hello! My name is Jasmine!
 
 I am currently an undergraduate student at UC Irvine pursuing a B.S. in Software Engineering. 
 Throughout my childhood, I have always loved coding. I participated in multiple programs such as Girls Who Code and Black Girls Code which sparked my interest early on. 
 My experiences with coding have given me the ability to swiftly comprehend programming languages and their intricacies, enabling me to address challenges with creativity and efficacy. 
 I am dedicated to achieving success and contributing positively to any team or project I am involved in and I consistently strive for excellence in both my personal and collaborative endeavors. 
 In my freetime, I enjoy playing games (such as Wizard101, Undertale, The Sims 4, and Nier Automata), hanging out with my friends, going on walks, and occasionally watching a nostalgic cartoon!
